## Projects

`Alpha`
__Iconeec__ Icon hosting web application aimed to make any icon or emoji uploaded by a user instantly available to be
rendered by anyone. Right now its a proof of concept limited to rendering the icons on the browser with a extension. I
developed a Opentype file parser in C# to be able to dynamically create font files for the icons and then enable the
browser to render them. Back-end built with NET core and SQL server, front-end with Vue.js and Bulma and published with
Azure. [[See project](https://bitbucket.org/roquecarrizof/iconeec)]
